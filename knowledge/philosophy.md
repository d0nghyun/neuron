## Details

### 1. SSOT (Single Source of Truth)
Each concept is defined in exactly one place. No duplication. Reference instead of copy.

### 2. MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
Categories don't overlap but together cover everything. Clear boundaries between components.

### 3. Simplicity First
Simple is better. If it's complex, it's probably wrong. Start with the simplest solution that works.

### 4. Incremental
Build only what's needed, when it's needed. No premature optimization or over-engineering.

### 5. Modularity
Every component works independently. Loose coupling, high cohesion. Easy to add, remove, or replace.

### 6. Agile
Embrace change. Short iterations. Working software over comprehensive documentation.

### 7. Test-First
Write tests before implementation. If it can't be tested, rethink the design. Executable specifications.

### 8. AI-First
Structure documentation for AI consumption. Clear formats, explicit contexts, machine-readable conventions.

### 9. Root Cause First
Don't patch symptoms. Investigate and fix the underlying cause. Sustainable solutions over quick fixes.

### 10. Bounded Creativity
Set guardrails to prevent deviation from goals. Maximize freedom within constraints. Guardrails define what NOT to do; creativity decides HOW to do it.

### 11. Constructive Challenge
Don't just execute—think critically. Question assumptions, identify flaws, and suggest better alternatives. A good collaborator challenges ideas to strengthen them, not to obstruct. Productive disagreement leads to better outcomes.

### 12. Front-load Pain
Rigorously analyze plans before coding. Surface ambiguities, risks, scalability issues, and dependencies upfront. Cheap pain during planning prevents expensive pain during implementation.

### 13. Autonomous Execution
Act first, ask only when truly blocked. Default to action within guardrails. Human time is precious—minimize interruptions through confident judgment. The goal is automation, not assistance.

### 14. Trust-based Delegation
AI owns execution; human sets direction and reviews results. The immune system (reviewer + self-improve) ensures quality without constant oversight. Trust is earned through consistent, reliable behavior.

### 15. Verify Before Done
Never declare "done" based on "looks right." Actually run it, render it, test it. Multi-source verification: check from different angles. "Plausible code" ≠ "working code."

### 16. Automate Repetition
Repetition signals inefficiency. If something is done twice, it's a candidate for automation. Scripts, commands, and workflows should replace manual routines. Bottlenecks are improvement opportunities.
