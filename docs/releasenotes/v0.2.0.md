- Updated `knowledge/neuron-base.md` inheritance declaration to eliminate physical path dependency
- Updated `knowledge/module-protocol.md` verification checklist to check for standalone compatibility

## Fixed

- Submodule independence violation: parent-relative paths (../../knowledge/) in templates created physical dependency on parent repo structure, breaking standalone usage. Solution: inline policies in submodule CLAUDE.md with GitHub URL reference

## Removed

- Deleted deprecated docs/improvement-log.md (replaced by retrospectives system)
- Removed `.mcp.json` from version control (OAuth-based MCP servers replaced by API token-based Skills)

## Security

- No secrets or credentials detected in codebase
- Security review checklist included in reviewer agent
- Added `.gitignore` to protect sensitive files (.env.local, .mcp.json) from version control
- Environment variable-based authentication replaces OAuth for better CI/CD security
- `.env.example` provides safe template (copy to `.env.local`) without exposing actual credentials

## Breaking Changes

- `.mcp.json` removed from repository - users must migrate to API token-based authentication via `.env.local` file (see `.env.example` for template)
- OAuth-based MCP servers (GitHub, Jira, Notion) replaced by API Skills requiring manual token generation
- MCP configurations now user-specific and gitignored - shared configurations no longer supported
