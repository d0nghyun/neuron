# Neuron Knowledge Reference

## When to Activate

This skill activates when the user asks about:
- Git workflow, commits, branches, PRs
- Project conventions and standards
- Architecture and module organization
- Philosophy and principles

## Knowledge Location

All documentation is in `/Users/dhlee/Git/personal/neuron/knowledge/`:
- `git-workflow.md` - Git conventions, worktree, revert strategies
- `github-settings.md` - Branch protection, PR settings, review policy

## How to Use

1. **Discover**: Check what docs exist in knowledge/
2. **Read**: Load relevant documentation
3. **Reference**: Quote specific sections in responses

## Example

User: "How should I name my branches?"

1. Read `knowledge/git-workflow.md`
2. Find the Branch Strategy section
3. Respond with the naming convention
