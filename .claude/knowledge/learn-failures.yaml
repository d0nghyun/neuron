  note: "Wrapup 2026-02-03 (arkraft-agent-alpha submit API fix): All failure entries cleared. Previous failures were environment-specific (psql schema migrations, read on directories) and tool-specific (chrome extension async syntax). These are not system patterns requiring automation - they're one-time setup issues or test-specific limitations."
