failures:
  - id: 2026-01-25-factory-skip
    date: 2026-01-25
    summary: Skill created without following factory pattern
    context: Created init-module skill without reading factory/README.md or pattern-skill.md
    symptoms:
      - Missing frontmatter
      - Wrong naming (no prefix)
      - Structure didn't match pattern
    root_cause: Skipped mandatory factory reference steps during rapid implementation
    resolution:
      - Read factory/README.md before creating
      - Read pattern-{type}.md for structure
      - Follow naming convention (api-*, workflow-*, etc.)
    prevention:
      - CLAUDE.md updated with "MANDATORY SEQUENCE - NO EXCEPTIONS"
      - Explicit step-by-step requirement added
    related_files:
      - CLAUDE.md
      - .claude/factory/README.md

  - id: 2026-01-25-prefix-inconsistency
    date: 2026-01-25
    summary: Existing agents have undefined prefixes
    context: role-*, task-* prefixes used but not defined in factory/README.md
    symptoms:
      - role-refactor.md, role-reviewer.md use undefined prefix
      - task-self-improve.md uses undefined prefix
    root_cause: Components created before factory conventions were fully established
    resolution: Renamed agents + updated factory/README.md with code-* prefix
    prevention: Always check factory/README.md naming conventions before creating
